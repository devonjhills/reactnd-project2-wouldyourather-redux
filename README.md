# Would You Rather Project: Redux

Final Project for the [Udacity React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

*Would You Rather?* is a web app that let's a user play the Would You Rather game. Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

This project is built with React and utilizes Redux for improving the predictability of the application’s state; establishing strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identifying what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.
